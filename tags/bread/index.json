        "body": " Whole Wheat Flour = 50% Buckwheat Flour = 5% Oat Flour = 5% Bread Flour = 40% Water = 75% Salt = 2% Yeast = 1.5% Honey = 10%  Saw a video where someone mentioned Buckwheat Flour and I wanted to try a loaf. I also did an egg wash on these which I usually don\u0026rsquo;t do. The crumb is very open, moist and flavorful. The crust is amazingly crisp and the loaf is full of flavor.\n"
