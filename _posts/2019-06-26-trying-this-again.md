I have previously attempted blogging, but found I often never had anything to say.

Now that I am exploring furniture making, I feel like I actually have something to offer to the masses of the internet. So, I am going to try this out and see where it goes. I am hoping to be able to share projects that I've made and tools that I have either build or restored.
